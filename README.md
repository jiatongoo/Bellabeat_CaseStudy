- As total steps increase, calories burned also increase, showing that more walking helps burn more calories.
- Most data points are concentrated around typical daily activity levels, primarily between 5,000 and 20,000 steps and 500 to 2,500 calories.

![Weekly Distribution of Total Steps](https://github.com/jiatongoo/Bellabeat_CaseStudy/blob/main/IMG/Weekly%20Distribution%20of%20Total%20Steps.jpg)
- Distribution of steps throughout the week:
  - Tuesday has the highest step count, exceeding 1.2 million steps.
  - Sunday has the lowest step count, around 800,000 steps.
- Users focus more on exercise during the mid-week and prefer to rest or engage in other activities that require less walking during the weekend.

![Average of StepTotal by Time](https://github.com/jiatongoo/Bellabeat_CaseStudy/blob/main/IMG/Average%20of%20StepTotal%20by%20Time.jpg)
- The step count is highest from morning to evening, showing the main period of daily activity that matches most people's routines.
- After 8:00 PM, the step count drops, as people start to relax.

![Time Spent in Bed](https://github.com/jiatongoo/Bellabeat_CaseStudy/blob/main/IMG/Time%20Spent%20in%20Bed.jpg)
- Sunday shows the longest time in bed, with more sleep hours.
- Users maintain a regular rest pattern during the week, with potential extra sleep recovery on weekends.

## Conclusions
- **Weekend and Night Activity Recommendations:** Step counts are lower on weekends and after 8 PM. Bellabeat can create suggestions for light activities such as walking, family exercises, or nighttime yoga to encourage moderate activity.
- **Increased Weekday Exercise Suggestions:** Users are more active on weekdays, especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Therefore, the app can include small exercise suggestions suitable for weekdays, such as office yoga or lunchtime walks, to help maintain their health.
- **Sleep Reminder Feature:** As most users get less than 8 hours of sleep, Bellabeat’s app could introduce a bedtime reminder feature, prompting female users when to go to bed for better sleep quality.

These recommendations can enhance Bellabeat users' health experience and encourage them to maintain a stable daily routine.
